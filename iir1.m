% Elliptic Highpass filter designed using FDESIGN.HIGHPASS.

% All frequency values are in Hz.
Fs = 200;  % Sampling Frequency

N     = 2;   % Order
Fpass = 2;   % Passband Frequency
Apass = 1;   % Passband Ripple (dB)
Astop = 80;  % Stopband Attenuation (dB)

% Construct an FDESIGN object and call its ELLIP method.
h  = fdesign.highpass('N,Fp,Ast,Ap', N, Fpass, Astop, Apass, Fs);
Hd = design(h, 'ellip');
